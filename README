This repository is supplemental to the following manuscript:

Baek S.-Y., Amano T., Akasaka M., and Koike S. Large terrestrial mammals resurging in a depopulating country.

This repository contains the codes used to estimate the process of range expansion and to analyse drivers of range expansion. 
This repository also include the code used to create the coefficients plots for Figure 3, results from analysis for drivers of range expansion.

You will find three codes

1) Expansion process: code to estimate the process of range expansion of large terrestrial mammals.

2) Expansion drivers: code used to analyse drivers of range expansion using used-available framework.

3) Coefficient plots: code to create Figure 3 for coefficients plots.
